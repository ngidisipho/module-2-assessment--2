                            <p>South African digital banking group Capitec is disrupting the local prepaid market with the launch of Capitec Connect: a new prepaid solution for voice, data and SMS.

                              At R4.50 per 100 Megabytes or R45 per Gigabyte, Capitec Connect data is apparently on average 50% below the normal market price, and the rates remain flat whether clients buy small or large quantities. The data also never expires provided the SIM is used at least once in 6 months, which means that Capitec clients never lose what they paid for.
                              
                              Gerrie Fourie, chief executive officer of Capitec, says, “South Africans have been complaining about the cost of data. It’s expensive and complicated. Bundle pricing, off-peak and peak rates, and the fact that your data expired are all things that make no sense. We’re changing this by giving our clients access to a mobile solution that is simpler to understand, much more affordable and can be recharged easily on our digital channels.”</p>
